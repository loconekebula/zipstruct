# Zip Hash C2PA

Zip file changes when another file (e.g., a c2pa manifest) is appended to it.

TODOs:
1) Add a file to a zipfile and study changes in it
2) Collect as many data as possible in hash computation, ignore changes triggered by manifest insertion
3) Create procedures to access zipfile metadata like EOCD (python libraries does not support this)
